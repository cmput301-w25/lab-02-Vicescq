## Lab Feedback

- Good work on the lab!
- Please make sure to put your Android Studio project in a seperate folder called `code` instead of in the base directory of the GitHub repository.
- Also, when you have the user enter input, make sure to validate it. Right now, a user can create a city with no name in your list by pressing submit without typing anything. This should be avoided.
